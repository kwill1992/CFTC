# Project Development for plotting and analyzing CFTC data.

### Premise: Develop something that looks like this:

To do: get a picture of old website.  
To do: get a picture of a current website.  
xxxxxxx

www.cftc.gov has this kind of data.  Looks like this...  
To do: show a screenshot of current data from cftc.gov


Goal: create something that might look like this but also shows max gains and losses.  Perhaps out to 
6 months and 12 months???


## Step 1: look around www.cftc.gov

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
